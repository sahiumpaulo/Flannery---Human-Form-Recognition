# Flannery -Human-Form-Recognition
Repository detailing the data architecture used for the Human Form Recognition data.

Most machines used in a plant hire have cameras monitoring its suroundings for the presence of any humans. Whenever a human gets to close proximity with a machine it will trigger an alert advising both the driver and the passerby. Accessing these alerts is extremely useful for Site Managers, to assess the safety of their workers and prevent any injuries or eventual casualties. Hence, the goal of this project is make this data acessible and facilitate site monitoring.
